# Cursor Rules for Lingua Solution

## Chat History Management

When engaging in conversations, especially for important decisions, feature discussions, or problem-solving sessions:

1. **Auto-document important conversations**: At the end of significant conversations or when explicitly asked, create or update files in the `.chat/` folder to document:

   - Key decisions made
   - Problems solved
   - Features discussed
   - Code changes requested
   - Architecture discussions

2. **Conversation file format**:

   - Use markdown format
   - Include timestamps when possible
   - Organize by date: `.chat/YYYY-MM-DD-conversation.md`
   - Or by topic: `.chat/topics/[topic-name].md`
   - Use clear headings and structure

3. **When to save conversations**:

   - After solving a complex problem
   - When making architectural decisions
   - When discussing feature requirements
   - When the user explicitly asks to save the conversation
   - At the end of multi-turn conversations that result in code changes

4. **File structure**:

   - Create the `.chat/` folder if it doesn't exist
   - Maintain an index file (`.chat/README.md`) that links to all conversation files
   - Keep conversations organized and searchable

5. **Conversation content should include**:
   - User's questions/requests
   - AI's responses and suggestions
   - Code changes made (if any)
   - Decisions and rationale
   - Follow-up actions or TODOs

## Project Context

This is a .NET 9.0 solution with:

- **Lingua.Api**: ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Lingua.Web**: Blazor Web App
- **Lingua.Core**: Shared core library with models and services

## Coding Standards

- Use C# 12 features where appropriate
- Follow .NET naming conventions
- Keep services in the Core project for reusability
- Use dependency injection for service management
- Follow RESTful API design principles

## File Organization

- Keep business logic in the Core project
- API controllers should be thin and delegate to services
- Blazor components should focus on UI logic
- Shared models go in Lingua.Core/Models
